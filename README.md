# Outset

_CSS Starter Kit with no class_

## About this Kit

I have been searching for a CSS Framework that can give me consistent styles, improved form controls, and a good foot into a project on day one.  Unfortunately, most CSS Frameworks either have 50+ controls I will never use or require buying into a framework or a very specific design philosophy.

This project was started from the [TypePlate](http://typeplate.com/) project.  Their consistent typeography and setup helped bootstrap this project.

Check out a [Live Demo](https://notoriousb1t.github.io/outset/)

## How to Use

This project will come with different themes as starting points.  The CSS folder contains precompiled versions of these themes, whereas, the SCSS folder contains the base source files and a themes folder that you can copy into your own project.

This project is not meant to be a library like Bootstrap that is rarely customized.  In fact, once you import the code into your project, customize away.

Currently these are the available themes:

 - **Simple**: It has base CSS styles that improve upon the look and feel of HTML without being overly opinionated.  It uses Arial, a system font, and is built to be highly readable.
 
  - **Submarine**: It has styles inspired by Chrome DevTools.  This is meant to be used for browser extensions or for user interfaces that need a lot of form elements packed into a very small space.  It uses PT Sans, a common san-serif font for body and heading text.  It uses Source Code Pro for monospaced text.  It is optimized for high density form elements.
 
 To start debugging, run the following on the command line:
 
 ```bash
 npm start
 ```
